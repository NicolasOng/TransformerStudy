Important files:
1. transformer.ipynb: I walked through the original Transformer paper in this notebook, with some help from other sources. I made comments and explantations to better understand the material myself.
2. transformer.py: Using the knowledge from the notebook, I implemented the encoder-decoder model seen in the original paper, and a decoder-only model.
3. train.py, generate.py, load_data.py: files to train a model - mostly testing.
